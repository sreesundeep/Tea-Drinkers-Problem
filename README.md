# Tea-Drinkers-Problem
Tea Drinkers Problem: A group of n tea drinkers sit around a table to drink tea and talk. To drink tea, each tea drinker requires a cup, a saucer, and a spoon and tea drinker cannot drink tea until the tea drinker has all three. There are only n-1 cups, n-1 saucers, and n-1 spoons but any tea drinker can take any cup, saucer, or spoon as long as it is free.
